      <div class="faq-question"><i class="fas fa-sync"></i> MegaTech Subscription Management & Tracking Services</div>
      <div class="faq-answers"><p>– Your Smart Partner for Handling Payments, Renewals, and Members with Ease.</p>
      <p>If you run a gym, school lesson business, club, training program, online course, or any subscription-based service, you already know one of the biggest headaches in your business: keeping track of who has paid, who hasn’t, and when renewals are due.</p>
      <p>That’s exactly where MegaTech steps in — to take the chaos out of managing your member or student subscriptions.</p>
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Why Subscription Tracking Matters</h3>
      <p>Without a proper system in place, things can spiral quickly. Here are real-world struggles that businesses face every day:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>🚫 Missed Payments & Lost Revenue.Example: A lesson center has 50 students. Five students stop paying, but the teacher doesn't realize it for two weeks. That’s two full weeks of unpaid classes—money lost that could have been recovered early.</li>
        <li>⏳ Time-Consuming Manual Tracking. Example: A gym owner uses notebooks to track over 100 clients. Every month-end is a mess—hours are wasted chasing people, confirming transfers, and updating spreadsheets manually.</li>
        <li>❌ Disputes Over Payments. Example: A student claims they’ve paid their lesson fee, but there’s no record of it. This leads to arguments and even losing the customer because of lack of proof.</li>
        <li>💸 Overpaying for Complex Tools. Subscription tools like Kajabi, Zen Planner, or Mindbody can cost $59 to $129+ monthly — a big expense for small businesses, especially when they don’t use most of the features.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>✅ How MegaTech Helps You Win</h3>
      <p>At MegaTech, we offer simple, customized, and powerful subscription management solutions that are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>🔐 Accurate & Reliable – Easily verify who has paid and when.</li>
        <li>⏱️ Time-Saving – Stop spending hours on admin; get automatic tracking updates.</li>
        <li>💰 Cost-Effective – Pay only for what you need. No bloated software bills.</li>
        <li>📱 Flexible – Manage both physical and online subscriptions from one place.</li>
        <li>🧾 Record-Proof – Keep a neat digital trail of every payment made.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We use tools like Google Sheets, Google Forms and automated dashboards to help small businesses maintain full control — without needing to be tech-savvy.</p>
      <h3>💸 Standard Pricing Based on Global Best Practices</h3>
      <p>Unlike overpriced platforms, MegaTech provides affordable and scalable pricing based on what top freelancers and service providers charge globally:</p>
